TC - Text Compiler
==================
This is just a glorified grouping of aliases I want to use with some combination of Latex, Markdown, and Pandoc.

Supported Output Types
----------------------
- [WIP] PDF
- [TODO] HTML
- [TODO] PPTX
- [TODO] DOCX

PDF "Options"
-------------
Pandoc is leveraged to build the input (presumably a markdown or Latex file) to pdf.

###Bibtex Support

###CSL Style Sheet support

TL;DR
-----
I'm lazy; this builds things from text...
