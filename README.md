TC - Text Compiler
==================
This is just a glorified grouping of aliases I want to use with some combination of Latex, Markdown, and Pandoc.

Supported Output Types
----------------------
- [WIP] PDF
- [TODO] HTML
- [TODO] PPTX
- [TODO] DOCX

PDF "Options"
-------------
Pandoc is leveraged to build the input (presumably a markdown or Latex file) to pdf.

###Bibtex Support
BibTex is a tool and format which describe references, which are mostly used with LaTeX[@BibTex].

###CSL Style Sheet support

##Formatting - Table of Contents

##Formatting - Margins

##Formatting - Black URL/Refeference links

TL;DR
-----
I'm lazy; this builds things from text...
